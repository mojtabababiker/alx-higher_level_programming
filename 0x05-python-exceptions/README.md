### Python has two types of Errors

**So in `Python` we have two types of Error, or in a second word, there are `Error` and `Exeptions`, so wahat's `Python Error` and what's `Python Exeption` and what's the diffrence between them.**

## Errors in python:

   The term `Error` in python refers to `Syntax Errors` which happens during the parsing proccess for the script, ie, The `IndentationError` and `SyntaxError`.

## Exeptions:

   Python use the term `Exeption` for the run time errors, `Exeptions` have many types and even there could be user defined ones too.

### **This repo is about the `Exeptions` and how to handel them.**
