# 0x03-python-data_structures

  -Data Structures or `DS`, what's it?-
  	In programing fields `DS` is how the data will be structured or placed inside the machine or the memory, it's one of the most importants concepts needs to be learn in the computer wordl, becuase knowing the best data structure to use makes a huge diffrents in the quality of your program.
  Like all the other programing languegs, knowing the langueg data structures concider the basic to learn it.
  `Python` has  diffrent `Data sturctures` with diffrents characteristics and uses, such as `List`, `Dictionary` wich concidered as the most famous data sructures in python, beside them there are more tha will be coverd later, but here we will be locking at `Lists` and `Sets`, how they struct data and how we can manipulates the data inside them.

## 0-print_list_integer.py

   *Function that prints all integers of a list.*
   - Prototype: `def print_list_integer(my_list=[]):`.
   - Format: one integer per line.
   - You are not allowed to import any module.
   - You can assume that the list only contains integers.
   - You are not allowed to cast integers into strings.
   - You have to use `str.format()` to print integers.

## 1-element_at.py

   *Function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.*
   - Prototype: `def element_at(my_list, idx):`
   - If `idx` is negative, the function should return `None`
   - If `idx` is out of range (> of number of element in `my_list`), the function should return `None`
   - You are not allowed to import any module
   - You are not allowed to use `try/except`
## 2-replace_in_list.py

   *Function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C).*
   - Prototype: def replace_in_list(my_list, idx, element):
   - If `idx` is negative, the function should not modify anything, and returns the original list
   - If `idx` is out of range (> of number of element in `my_list`), the function should not modify anything, and returns the original list
   - You are not allowed to import any module
   - You are not allowed to use `try/except`

## 3-print_reversed_list_integer.py

   *Function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.*
   - Prototype: `def print_reversed_list_integer(my_list=[]):`
   - Format: one integer per line
   - You are not allowed to import any module
   - You can assume that the list only contains integers
   - You are not allowed to cast integers into strings
   - You have to use `str.format()` to print integers

## 4-new_in_list.py

   *Function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C).*
   - Prototype: `def new_in_list(my_list, idx, element):`
   - If `idx` is negative, the function should return a copy of the original list
   - If `idx` is out of range (> of number of element in `my_list`), the function should return a copy of the original list
   - You are not allowed to import any module
   - You are not allowed to use `try/except`

## 5-no_c.py

   *Function that removes all characters c and C from a string.*
   - Prototype: `def no_c(my_string):`
   - The function should return the new string
   - You are not allowed to import any module
   - You are not allowed to use `str.replace()`

## 6-print_matrix_integer.py
