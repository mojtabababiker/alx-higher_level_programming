# Test Driven Development

  ### `TDD` is a software development practice that emphasizes writing tests befoe writing the actual code. and then start by writing code that satisfies those test cases.

  ### According to `Robert C. Martin`, aka Uncle Bob, describes the `Three laws of TDD` as:

      1. **You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.**

      2. **You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficent to fail, and compilation failures are failures.**

      3. **You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.**

      ### `Javier Saldana` summarized or set a concise version of `The Three Laws of TDD` that I found them easier to understand and obseved.

      1. **Write only enough of a unit test to fail.**

      2. **Write only enough producion code to make the falling unit test pass.**

      ## The importance of `TDD`


      **`TDD` helps to develop the logic in your code, by starting tests with the simplest functionality first, they can be used to guide the logic in your code as you build up functionalit. This helps you to break a problem down into smaller, more mangaeble pieces and then aiding teh problem solving proccess.**

      ### So in this project and the upcoming ones we will be used the `TDD` princibles in all our problems solving
